Railsbench is a small collection of ruby and shell scripts which make
measuring raw performance of rails apps a snap. All tests are run from
the command prompt making performance regression testing easy.

In addition, a patch for the ruby garbage collector is provided, which
can be used to reduce the amount of time spent doing garbage
collection, trading memory for speed, as usual (see file GCPATCH for
details).

This software was written and conceived by Stefan Kaes. The author can
be reached via email: <skaes at gmx dot net>. Please send comments, bug
reports, patches or feature requests to this address.

ENVIRONMENT

  RAILS_ROOT
                - must be set to point to your rails app

  RAILS_PERF_DATA
                - performance data sets will be stored into this directory
                  if not set, $HOME will be used

  RAILS_PERF_RUNS
                - the number of times perf_loop will run perf_bench on a single invocation
                  if not set, 3 runs will be performed

  RAILS_BENCHMARK_FILE
                - perf_bench send its output to this file


USAGE

The two main scripts are named perf_run and perf_diff.

    perf_run 100

runs the list of urls named "default" specified in benchmkarks.yml
(see below), requesting each url $RAILS_PERF_RUNS * 100 times.

   perf_run 100 "-bm=list -aws"

runs the benchmark named 'list' and passes the expanded second
argument to the rails app. By processing arguments inside your
environment.rb file, you can set performance affecting options. For
example, you could load action web service only if -aws is passed and
measure the performance effect of omitting it.

Benchmark data is stored in directory $RAILS_PERF_DATA, which should
be set in your environment. If not set, $HOME is used. By default,
data is stored in file $RAILS_PERF_DATA/perf_run.$BENCHMARK.txt, where
BENCHMARK will be set according to the -bm option.

   perf_run 100 "-bm=index -mail" mail

will store benchmark data in file
$RAILS_PERF_DATA/`current-date´.index.mail.txt.

You can get nicely formatted output of benchmark data by running

  perf_times file

Script perf_run will automatically print the obtained data after
finishing the run using perf_times.

Script perf_diff runs a list of urls with two different option lists. So

  perf_diff 100 "-bm=blogs -mysql_session" "-mail=0" "-mail=1" cf1 cf2

would run benchmark 'blogs' twice, first as

  perf_run 100 "-bm=blogs -mysql_session -mail=0" cf1

and then
  
  perf_run 100 "-bm=blogs -mysql_session -mail=1" cf2

printing a comparison of the bechmark data obtained after finishing
the second run. cf1 and cf2 can be omitted, in which case data is
stored in $RAILS_PERF_DATA/perf_run1.$BENCHMARK.txt and
$RAILS_PERF_DATA/perf_run2.$BENCHMARK.txt.

Script perf_bench can also be invoked manually to run a given
benchmark like so:

  perf_bench 100 -bm=blogs -mysql_session -mail=1 >/dev/null

Performance data is sent to $RAILS_BENCHMARK_FILE, HTML output ends up
on stdout. If RAILS_BENCHMARK_FILE is not set, performance data is
sent to stderr.

Scripts perf_run_gc and perf_times_gc can be used to analyse GC performance:

  perf_run_gc 100 "-bm=all -lib=stable11" gc.log
  perf_times_gc gc.log

It will produce output looking like this:

GC data file: d:/perfdata/xp/perf_run.uncached.gc.txt

collections            :        40
garbage total          :   8188429
gc time total (sec)    :         4.03
garbage per request    :      2047.11
requests per collection:       100.00

                     mean  stddev%          min          max
gc time(ms):       101.38     10.0        93.00       125.00
heap slots :    400000.00      0.0    400000.00    400000.00
live       :    192914.31      0.2    191787.00    193197.00
freed      :    207085.69      0.2    206803.00    208213.00
freelist   :         0.00      0.0         0.00         0.00

Note that these numbers, especially requests per collection, are only
an approximation. This is due to the fact that run_urls will add one
final garbage collection call at the end of the run. Of course, higher
number of iterations will produce more accurate data. Also, if the
benchmark lists several uris, garbage per request will not give you
meaningful information.


CONFIGURATION

Benchmarks are configured through file benchmarks.yml. Example:

  default:
    index, other

  index:
    uri: /test/index
    new_session: true

  other:
    -
      uri: /test/list
    -
      uri: /test/alphabetic
      query_params: page=7

defines 3 benchmarks:

  "other"    consists of 2 urls (/test/list and /test/alphabetic)
  "index"    will run (/test/index)
  "default"  will run all urls in "index" and "other"

uri: is mandatory, query_params: and new_session: are optional.

Instead of

    uri: /test/alphabetic
    query_params: page=7

one could have written

    uri: /test/alphabetic?page=7
    
new_session: specifies whether a session cookie is sent with the
request (default). To make this work correctly, you need to set
session_data on the benchmarker instance. See benchmarks.rb for details.
