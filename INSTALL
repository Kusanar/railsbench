============
INSTALLATION
============

STEP 1:

The file site-ruby/benchmark.rb is a drop in replacement for the
benchmark.rb file that comes with the ruby distribution. Copy it over
the old one or install it into your ruby site-ruby directory
(e.g. /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby, /usr/local/lib/ruby/site-ruby).

Setup the enviroment variable RAILS_ROOT to point to your apps base
directory (which should have config as subdirectory).

Add the railsbench script subdirectory to your search path.


STEP 2:

Manual installation:
  Copy benchmarks.rb and benchmarks.yml into $RAILS_ROOT/config and
  edit them to suit your needs. The provided default benchmark.yml
  will run the root URL of your app.

  Copy benchmarking.rb to $RAILS_ROOT/config/environments and add a
  corresponding section to database.yml.

Automatic installation:
  Run install.rb. This will perform all of the above steps and create
  a section in database.yml pointing to your development database. In
  case you are worrying about possible results, you can call
  install.rb --dry-run first.


OPTIONAL (but recommended)

Patch the ruby garbage collector using rubygc.patch. Recompile ruby
and copy the ruby binary to where it was previously installed.
See GCPATCH for details on how to influence the patched ruby gc.
