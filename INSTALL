INSTALLATION

The file benchmark.rb is a drop in replacement for the benchmark.rb
file that comes with the ruby distribution. Copy benchmark.rb over the
old one or install it into your ruby site-ruby directory
(e.g. /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby, /usr/local/lib/ruby/site-ruby).

Setup the enviroment variable RAILS_ROOT to point to your apps base
directory (which should have config as subdirectory).

Copy benchmarks.rb and benchmarks.yml into $RAILS_ROOT/config and edit
them to suit your needs.

Add the directory to where you have extracted railsbench to your
search path and change the #! lines in the scripts to point to the
ruby interpeter and bash (default /usr/local/bin/ruby and /bin/bash).


OPTIONAL

Patch the ruby garbage collector using rubygc.patch. Recompile ruby
and copy the ruby binary to where it was previously installed.
See GCPATCH for details on how to influence the patched ruby gc.
