           RAILSBENCH INSTALLATION
==================================================

STEP 1: installing railsbench and PATH modification
---------------------------------------------------

If you obtained and installed railsbench as a gem, a script called
railsbench is available in your Ruby bin directory. railsbench is a
simple driver for the railsbench scripts, which are located in the gem
installation directory. Example:

    railsbench perf_run 100 -bm=all

Alternatively, add the railsbench script directory to your search
path. The exact place can be found running

    railsbench base

which prints the script directory path. Another option is to run

    eval `railsbench path`

Since gem packages don't support running postinstall scripts, you will
need to make the scripts executable by running

   sudo railsbench postinstall

After performing these steps, individual commands can be run directly:

    perf_run 100 -bm=all

The environment variable RAILS_ROOT must be set and point to your apps
base directory, in order for railsbench to work properly.

If you obtained railsbench as a svn checkout, add the railsbench
script directory to your search path.


STEP 2: prepare your application for benchmarking
-------------------------------------------------

Manual installation:

  Copy benchmarks.rb and benchmarks.yml into $RAILS_ROOT/config and
  edit them to suit your needs. The provided default benchmark.yml
  will run the root URL of your app.

  Copy benchmarking.rb to $RAILS_ROOT/config/environments and add a
  corresponding section to database.yml.

Automatic installation:

  Run 'railsbench install'. This will perform all of the above steps
  and create a configuration named 'benchmarking' in database.yml
  pointing to your development database. In case you are worrying
  about possible results, you can call railsbench install --dry-run
  first.

In either case, run `railsbench generate_benchmarks'. This will create
a benchmarks.yml file with a benchmark for each controller and action.


STEP 3: optional (but highly recommended)
-----------------------------------------

Patch the ruby garbage collector using rubygc18{45}.patch, depending
on your ruby version. Recompile ruby and copy the ruby binary and
shared libs to where they were previously installed. See GCPATCH for
details on how to influence the patched ruby gc.
